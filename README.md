 English | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)<br>
  
AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations), that is, intelligent operation and maintenance, is to combine the capabilities of artificial intelligence with operation and maintenance, and improve the efficiency of operation and maintenance through machine learning methods. <br>

The author is fortunate to join the world's leading communication equipment manufacturer after graduating from university, and has in-depth cooperation with Chinese operators. As the main core designer, he designed multiple sets of AIOPS systems for the operator's large-scale data center, and shared the previously collected data. , I hope to do my best to promote the development of the community.
